I loved the beautifully written prose and jumping between time periods and perspectives of characters, in new and unfamiliar surroundings, kept the pace moving swiftly along. An enjoyable and insightful read.",

There is also a threatening undertone - but I found the Japanese words no obstacle to understanding and savouring the text.",

In this case it's the bond between Julia and Eve, tested against the backdrop of Vienna pre and post First World War, then again in the late 1930s and life under the Nazis. Vienna is beautifully captured in this absorbing and evocative story that doesn't shy away from addressing antisemitism, homophobia and the violence of the period.",

Narrated in turns by their two guides, one gay and the other homophobic, their relationship is one of the most intriguing aspects of the book.",

It is not a depressing read, despite the subject, and I am sure that reading about how the mother gets through the stages of grief could be a consoling process for someone going through a similar experience.",

This is such a powerful story with memorable characters which made this book totally gripping. I loved it and lived through Sara's tension right to the end.",

Dolly, based on Grenville\u2019s grandmother, wants to be a teacher but her father forbids it which frustrates Dolly her whole life. Her bitterness is understandable but sadly it becomes a burden for her children. Nevertheless I admired her resilience. She died disillusioned but her sacrifice made it easier for her daughter to follow her ambition.",

        "description": "This is a devastating yet beautiful story of a Syrian refugee who watches the world from her window. Her elective mutism is a defence against the traumas of the destruction of her life in her home country and her dangerous journey to the UK. In between flashbacks, the fragile stability of her life in the UK is revealed as racist violence invades her supposedly \u2018safe\u2019 space. A powerful and moving read \u2013 and much food for thought.",

This emotionally charged romantic comedy is a mad-cap romp across time and different fictional genres. It is a great antidote to the stress of these current fraught times, inducing in me an unexpected nostalgia for the Nineties! <br /><br />",

Frances's passive acceptance may test some readers, but this is an affecting book, full of powerful imagery and worth staying with all the way.  One for the top of the TBR list!",

They are contrasting personalities: Rose the social butterfly living in the now; Marigold the introverted overthinker who already feels intense nostalgia for the passing of time. Warmly and with a wry grin, the book allows us to reflect too, on ourselves and on time. In these slim 52 pages, I found a vast sense of empathy, sadness and wonder.",
